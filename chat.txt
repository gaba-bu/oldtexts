[15/09/25, 7:04:33 PM] Himisha: 1. get your digilocker; login or signup and upload your aadhar card details. don't worry; its govt issued so its safe. 
2. go to this website https://www.abc.gov.in/  and apply for appar id. they'll ask for your student registration number and your year of admission along with your University. fill up those details; they'll ask some opts, fill them.
3. your apaar id will be displayed; copy it and paste it in this form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-4EIdJDqWVESPUQltaRfScKKP7Um_BTNXa6vxkrHF8ds-EQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=103482841341031370076 
 - along with the other details. 
4. It will be updated in a few days or whenever GITAM feels like they should. But we will get our apaar id off so that's mostly it.
[15/09/25, 7:04:34 PM] Himisha: follow this
[15/09/25, 7:04:34 PM] Himisha: then do either of the following 2 options; ticketing it is better. they are usually done with it in under 2 days
[15/09/25, 7:04:34 PM] Himisha: Dear Students,
Option 1:-(preferred option)
Student can raise a Ticket choosing option of "Evaluation" and request for updation of APAAR ID (preferred option) with the following details:

a)Student PIN number
b)APAAR ID
c)Attachment of the acknowledgement generated APAAR ID

(or)

Option 2:-
Students whose APAAR ID has not yet been updated in the GITAM Student Portal are requested to send an email to the Controller of Examinations with the following details:

a)Student PIN number
b)APAAR ID
c)Attachment of the acknowledgement generated APAAR ID

Email ID of Controller of Examinations: controllerofexaminations@gitam.edu
[15/09/25, 7:04:35 PM] Himisha: make sure your aadhar is updated
[15/09/25, 7:04:35 PM] Himisha: and that you have a digilocker
[15/09/25, 7:04:35 PM] Himisha: and they'll ask a lot of OTPs to fill so make sure you have your phone on standby
[15/09/25, 7:04:36 PM] Himisha: an easier way to do it would be through your digilocker app, search for appar id and you can directly do it off from your phone then you can raise a ticket from the gitam login portal or the my gitam app
[15/09/25, 7:04:36 PM] Himisha: helpdesk
[15/09/25, 7:04:36 PM] Himisha: under the domain of evaluation

[10/11/25, 12:00:56 AM] Samuel Manas: Happy birthday, baby. I’ve been waiting for this day just to tell you how much you truly mean to me. You’ve changed my life in such a beautiful way not by doing anything big, but just by being you. Your presence and the way you talk, the way you laugh… it all stays in my heart forever… I want your birthday to remind you of how special you actually are. Not just to me, but in general. You’re someone with such a good heart, even on the days when you don’t feel like it. You deserve all the happiness, love, and calm in your life, and I’ll always be someone who tries to give you that. Thank you for being part of my world. I hope this year gives you everything that you’ve dreamed off and i can’t wait to be the person to witness and support you through every single thing and most importantly to be by your side and holding your hand when you feel like giving up, i will go through it all for you and with you. I love you more than I can ever explain.

[22/11/25, 11:10:43 AM] Himisha: I've been reading this again and again, I read it atleast 10 times
you're such a precious soul
I gotta be so lucky to even know you, ig I'm really the luckiest on this planet cuz you're gonna be with me forever, you're gonna be my person for the rest of my life 
i love you so much, I can never properly express, no words no actions are enough to show my love for you, I'm just patiently waiting every single day for that one day when all this ends and we can have our storytale version of "living happily ever after"
[22/11/25, 11:15:58 AM] Himisha: i LOVE the emotional maturity you have, i saw a lot of guys lack that and I was very scared in general, but with you, idc how many ever arguments we have, i always have this little feeling inside me ki it'll all be sorted soon and we'll be back together in each other's arms laughing about it, which happens every single time 
the way you're so understanding, so empathetic, so affectionate, ig i really just lucked out in life frr💘

[27/11/25, 11:05:43 PM] Himisha: i just posted one story, of our selfies
[27/11/25, 11:05:56 PM] Himisha: which was entirely about that restaurant and that song
[27/11/25, 11:06:24 PM] Himisha: we were all laughing at that and we just wanted to post about it
[27/11/25, 11:06:46 PM] Samuel Manas: and that’s fine
[27/11/25, 11:06:51 PM] Himisha: and you got mad at that too
[27/11/25, 11:07:04 PM] Himisha: it did not seem like it was fine, Samuel
[27/11/25, 11:07:13 PM] Samuel Manas: i’m not mad about your stories
[27/11/25, 11:07:57 PM] Himisha: you wouldn't say "you don't feel like showing yourself to me, but post it to 800 ppl" if you weren't mad about that
[27/11/25, 11:08:34 PM] Himisha: i never said anything about your stories
[27/11/25, 11:08:44 PM] Himisha: infact I always like them too
[27/11/25, 11:08:50 PM] Himisha: you never do that either
[27/11/25, 11:08:57 PM] Himisha: i never complained
[27/11/25, 11:09:31 PM] Himisha: if you really wanna talk about all that, there are so many things i never complain about
[27/11/25, 11:09:41 PM] Samuel Manas: please tell
[27/11/25, 11:09:52 PM] Himisha: i can't list all of them rn
[27/11/25, 11:10:09 PM] Samuel Manas: whatever it is let’s just get it over with today
[27/11/25, 11:10:42 PM] Himisha: i know, that your thoughts and ideas of expressing love and mine are way different, and i completely get it, which is why I never say anything
[27/11/25, 11:11:37 PM] Himisha: and I kinda act like I'm mad about the little things, but I'm never really mad about it
[27/11/25, 11:11:41 PM] Himisha: cuz i understand
[27/11/25, 11:11:43 PM] Himisha: and i stop
[27/11/25, 11:11:47 PM] Himisha: but
[27/11/25, 11:11:53 PM] Himisha: I'm not really getting that from you
[27/11/25, 11:12:06 PM] Himisha: I'm not understanding why you're behaving like that
[27/11/25, 11:12:11 PM] Himisha: why you're getting mad at me
[27/11/25, 11:12:22 PM] Himisha: I'm honestly not able to understand what you're thinking
[27/11/25, 11:12:39 PM] Himisha: we always say that, but it never happens
[27/11/25, 11:12:52 PM] Himisha: this will keep continuing
[27/11/25, 11:12:58 PM] Himisha: it will continue till the end
[27/11/25, 11:13:07 PM] Samuel Manas: i want you to say about me so i’ll know
[27/11/25, 11:13:25 PM] Himisha: i will, what I should, i will
[27/11/25, 11:13:38 PM] Samuel Manas: i didn’t get you
[27/11/25, 11:14:00 PM] Himisha: whatever I want you to change, I will always tell you about that
[27/11/25, 11:14:40 PM] Himisha: but not the smallest of things, it'll just be like I'm controlling the way I wanna be loved, i don't wanna do that, i wanna be loved the way you wanna love me
[27/11/25, 11:15:05 PM] Himisha: so even tho I don't like some small things sometimes, i won't really say that to you
[27/11/25, 11:15:19 PM] Himisha: but if there's something that's really bothering me, I'll definitely tell you
[27/11/25, 11:15:43 PM] Himisha: instead of being mad at you, and saying all such things that you said to me today
[27/11/25, 11:15:56 PM] Himisha: it all really hurt me
[27/11/25, 11:16:05 PM] Himisha: and I started doubting everything
[27/11/25, 11:16:32 PM] Himisha: did I not love you enough? did I not give you enough?
[27/11/25, 11:17:25 PM] Samuel Manas: you gave me more than enough
[27/11/25, 11:17:39 PM] Samuel Manas: i feel i was the one that is not
[27/11/25, 11:18:14 PM] Himisha: it really did not seem that way
[27/11/25, 11:19:08 PM] Himisha: and about the reservations, I'm really very sorry, but I don't really think we should be meeting rn, after what all happened today
[27/11/25, 11:19:24 PM] Himisha: i still don't wanna talk to you
[27/11/25, 11:19:32 PM] Himisha: you've hurt me very much
[27/11/25, 11:20:09 PM] Samuel Manas: i get it
[27/11/25, 11:20:23 PM] Samuel Manas: i’m sorry

[27/11/25, 11:20:54 PM] Samuel Manas: i cant change this

[27/11/25, 11:21:25 PM] Samuel Manas: please come back to me
[27/11/25, 11:21:38 PM] Samuel Manas: that’s all i can say now
[27/11/25, 11:21:57 PM] Samuel Manas: i’m sorry for everything
[27/11/25, 11:21:57 PM] Himisha: I'm not going anywhere
[27/11/25, 11:22:07 PM] Himisha: I'm still always yours
[27/11/25, 11:22:43 PM] Himisha: i started doubting that too
[27/11/25, 11:22:55 PM] Himisha: it just seemed like you were done dealing with me
[27/11/25, 11:23:08 PM] Himisha: and i thought i genuinely didn't deserve anything at all
[27/11/25, 11:23:13 PM] Himisha: and I still feel that way
[27/11/25, 11:23:18 PM] Himisha: i even said it
[27/11/25, 11:24:11 PM] Himisha: also
[27/11/25, 11:26:11 PM] Himisha: see, even here, your way of expressing love was to take me somewhere nice, eat good food and spend some time together, and i on the other hand just wanted to see you, and hold you, and hug you, and was so ready to just come off to you, unplanned
[27/11/25, 11:26:14 PM] Himisha: it's just

[22/12/25, 7:50:33 PM] Samuel Manas: i’m sorry mishu i don’t know what i am doing… i feel like shit i don’t know why… i am making you sad and upset very much recently… i am making you cry almost everyday… i don’t want that to happen… i don’t know what is wrong with me.. typing this message i’m feeling so hard to type.. i don’t want to cry but it is coming i’m not able to stop it. you mean so much to me and i am ready to do anything for us to be happy. i love you with all my heart… i just don’t know know what is happening to me… and i don’t even know what i’m typing at this point… i love you so much… i’ll try to be a better man for you every single day… i love you.. i don’t want you to feel this way ever again… i love you so much mishu.. i’m sorry
[22/12/25, 9:10:17 PM] Himisha: baby i love you so muchhh 
and I just love being around you all the time and I love being yours, I love being with you everyday, i just love you so much, you've become my everything, the first person i talk to in the morning as soon as I wake up and the last one before sleeping, and I text you everytime something happens to me, be it small or big, i love updating you w everything, you've literally become my whole world, and I can never survive without you anymore, I'm so thankful for having you w me, how we met, how we started talking, and all the series of events between us, they were all aligned for us to become what we are now, totally inseparable, and always loving eachother endlessly every single day, i can never lose you, and I'm never ever leaving you, this is the one thing i want you to always, and I mean ALWAYS remember, you're the love of my life, you're the best thing that has happened to me in my entire life, i don't care about anyone else as much as I do about you, you're my EVERYTHING!
[22/12/25, 9:11:08 PM] Himisha: you're the perfect person for me, the best man i could've asked God for, infact better than that, you're all I ever needed in this life, nothing more, nothing less, you're just PERFECT
[22/12/25, 9:21:32 PM] Himisha: and about me crying regularly, look i just love you so much okay, like I've never experienced this kind of pure love before, from someone that's not my family, we met just a few months ago, and you've given me so much love and care, more than someone could've given me my entire life so far, and i just... got used to this, i got used to you, and your love and your care, that even the slightest shift in it is making me emotional 
and whenever that happens, i just want you, only you, i just want you to be there with me, to hold me, and to give me some time, that's all I need
I'm gonna need some time to understand things, i honestly don't even know why, it's these stupid hormones that play w me, cuz everytime i do something stupid, i can literally understand it's wrong, and I keep asking myself why I'm behaving like such a bitch, but I just can't stop it, it just keeps happening, even the smallest of things are making me sad, and idk why
and all I can do is tell you, tell you how i feel, how it affected me, and when I do that, the tears start running down and idek why that happens, i just got so used to bottling up my emotions so much, i tend to cry everytime I open up, and I do that very rarely, but with you, baby, i can tell you everything, anytime, and you'll always listen to me and understand me, and i realise HOW MUCH you truly love me, and how strong your love is, and i feel so good after i share it w you, i stop crying, i feel so light and SO good
so everytime i cry, it's out of love I have for you, not because I'm upset
[22/12/25, 9:26:55 PM] Himisha: you said I was so strong emotionally,
let me tell you something, I'm not!
i hide my emotions, i hide it all, cuz I don't want others to get hurt, looking at me being sad, i can't go crying about my dad to my mom, cuz she has lost so much more compared to me, she lost the love of her life, she lost her soulmate, the person she spent almost 20 yrs of her life with, and thought she would spend with, till she died, compared to her, my loss is literally nothing, so I had to be her pillar, i had to be the shoulder she could cry on, which is why I never expressed my feelings, and since i never did that, i automatically cry whenever i do that 
i will slowly stop doing that, cuz I'm getting more and more comfortable w you, i don't have to cry anymore, to express my feelings and my worries
[22/12/25, 9:28:35 PM] Himisha: i typed so much, i tried my best to explain it properly to you, read it whenever you can 
please stop blaming yourself love, everything you're doing is absolutely right, and I will tell you whenever i want you to change anything, just don't keep blaming yourself for me crying, its not at all your fault
[22/12/25, 9:29:01 PM] Himisha: and always know this, 
I LOVE YOU 
and I'll always love you no matter what

[29/12/25, 8:46:11 PM] Samuel Manas: i felt like you didn’t feel safe with me today… i’m sorry for that, i really am… i hate that feeling… i know my actions and words led you to feel that way… but seeing you push away from me broke my heart… the thing with you is that you don’t tell me what’s happening… until it’s too late… sometimes not even then.. i want you to tell me everything and anything… especially the ones that might hurt me… those are the most important ones to communicate. i try to make you to talk but you’re too stubborn at that moment. i can’t help it but to say that i want you to tell me how you feel… doesn’t matter if it makes me feel bad… i’m sure I’ll understand… atleast I’ll try…
[29/12/25, 8:46:29 PM] Samuel Manas: you didn’t feel like talking to me once, since then ?
[29/12/25, 10:01:21 PM] Himisha: you never spoke to me like that, so i didn't know what to do, you seemed really mad at me I got so scared, i got scared of you for the first time ever, and I don't wanna be scared of you, i didn't feel like I was talking to you, you seemed like a completely different person and I wasn't comfortable, i should prolly get used to you being like that if we're gonna keep fighting like this in the future too, but please don't ever hit me, i wanna be completely honest with you, the way you folded the pen and threw it, the way you kept pulling and pushing me around, how you kept moving my hands when I was putting it on the table, and then how you were pulling my face to look at you, and the way you were talking to me, all of that felt so new and so not you and at one point i thought you were gonna hit me or something, i got so scared and that's why I wasn't talking 
you know how much i overthink and what all goes on in my head, i was just really scared of you
and cried off, I could do nothing but cry, especially when you knew I was upset and you were watching reels and laughing, it felt like you didn't care about me at all and were fed up of me, of me crying all the time, cuz I just can't help it, idk why I cry, it's prolly cuz I'm comfortable with you and ik you won't judge me for that, but i thought anduke you don't care about me crying anymore and you didn't really care about me being upset either
[29/12/25, 10:05:30 PM] Himisha: and about not telling you, ik you know why I was upset, you always know, ik you understand me that well and you always know what's wrong with me
i told you not to ask me multiple times, especially when you know
because everything i sulk, be it even for small things, i just want you to be there w me and reassure me instead you sulking back at me for not telling you what happened, because you already know, and idk why you always want me to tell you that when you already know it all
i don't tell you because everytime this happens, and then later when it's sorted, i tell you what happened to me, just to hear yeah I knew it, I knew it the whole time, then why even pull it this long? I'm not blaming you entirely, my fault is there too, but I don't understand why you do all that just to tell me you knew it all along
[29/12/25, 10:07:59 PM] Himisha: i did, i told you I always want to talk to you, even when we're fighting, or even when I'm mad at you, i just didn't know what to say
i was relieved when you called me but you just kept asking if I didn't wanna talk to you, and why I was so irritated, when you were literally about to end the call saying i wasn't ready to listen, but i clearly said I wanted to listen to you and asked you to talk but you kept asking if I didn't wanna talk again
[29/12/25, 10:09:11 PM] Himisha: yes i was pissed cuz you kept asking me the same thing tho I said I wanted to talk to you, also my stop came 
and I didn't know what to talk about, the only thing i could say was sorry, because i couldn't even be mad at you and point out your mistakes cuz you would do the same thing then
[29/12/25, 10:11:23 PM] Himisha: but you really hurt me today, I'm not gonna cry anymore, I will never cry anymore, i gotta be strong like i always was, even infront of you, that's what I understood after all that happened today, cuz even after i cried sm, you still kept asking what happened, and said i believed that astrology thing, tho I told you in the morning I was so sad when i remembered that and that it's def supposed to be a wrong prediction
you still decided to say that, and then you said you didn't mean it in that way, what else could that mean then?
[29/12/25, 10:12:23 PM] Himisha: but then again,
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry for sulking at you
I'm sorry for playing that game
I'm sorry for crying 
I'm sorry for telling you things
I'm sorry for everything
[29/12/25, 10:12:30 PM] Himisha: i don't wanna be a burden
[29/12/25, 10:13:26 PM] Himisha: I'm also the reason you don't wanna ask your parents for money and are looking for a side hustle to earn money, you're doing it all for me and I don't wanna keep fighting with you, I'm very sorry for all that happened today
[29/12/25, 10:13:40 PM] Himisha: you don't deserve to go through all this so frequently
[29/12/25, 10:14:09 PM] Himisha: I'll try my best to change, to stay more strong and not so emotional and sensitive

[29/12/25, 10:17:38 PM] Himisha: I'm sorry for what all you had to go through today, i really am ❤️
[29/12/25, 10:23:26 PM] Samuel Manas: i was mad… i was so mad. i could never hit you or any female… i didnt know what to do either i had so much anger built inside me.. i threw my phone to the wall after coming home. i am still angry. what am i angry at ? i don’t know.. maybe i’m angry at myself
[29/12/25, 10:24:07 PM] Samuel Manas: just because i know doesn’t mean you don’t tell me
[29/12/25, 10:24:58 PM] Samuel Manas: so you won’t tell me things or cry in front of me from now ?
[29/12/25, 10:25:32 PM] Samuel Manas: i agree that was my mistake to bring that up
[29/12/25, 10:25:58 PM] Himisha: i will try not to
[29/12/25, 10:26:11 PM] Samuel Manas: you not telling me is a burden, not the other way around
[29/12/25, 10:27:45 PM] Himisha: i would tell you, only if you actually listened and cared instead of just saying you already knew if and shrug it off
[29/12/25, 10:28:06 PM] Himisha: i really don't know what to say anymore
[29/12/25, 10:28:11 PM] Himisha: i don't know what to do
[29/12/25, 10:28:16 PM] Samuel Manas: oh i don’t care now… okay
[29/12/25, 10:30:21 PM] Samuel Manas: i never admit that you hurt me. 
i never admit that i’m sad. 
i try to hide my anxiety attacks from you because you’ll feel bad. 
i try to justify everything i do.
[29/12/25, 10:30:26 PM] Samuel Manas: all this because i don’t care
[29/12/25, 10:30:28 PM] Samuel Manas: cool
[29/12/25, 10:30:57 PM] Himisha: ik you care about me, i didn't say you don't care about me, i was telling about that moment, honestly idek what I'm talking atp, you do care about me, i didn't mean that
[29/12/25, 10:31:12 PM] Himisha: that is exactly why I don't wanna tell you too
[29/12/25, 10:31:33 PM] Samuel Manas: good, we’ll keep things from each other from now
[29/12/25, 10:31:50 PM] Himisha: you're still not getting it

[29/12/25, 10:33:34 PM] Himisha: be mad at me that's ok, it's valid
[29/12/25, 10:33:41 PM] Samuel Manas: what are you trying to say then
[29/12/25, 10:33:56 PM] Himisha: if only I didn't behave like such a bitch, none of this would've happened
[29/12/25, 10:34:10 PM] Himisha: idk, I'm not able to explain it, i don't think i can
[29/12/25, 10:34:37 PM] Himisha: this is what is scaring me even more

[29/12/25, 10:39:02 PM] Samuel Manas: i dont have money to break anything
[29/12/25, 10:39:24 PM] Himisha: I'm sorry, it's all my fault and I really shouldn't have behaved like that, I'm really very sorry
[29/12/25, 10:39:47 PM] Himisha: and what if one day, you have it?
[29/12/25, 10:40:24 PM] Samuel Manas: i dont want sorry’s i want an explanation
[29/12/25, 10:41:40 PM] Himisha: I've always been asked to stay away from guys that break things when they can't hit you, cuz it can happen any moment, with or without realising, and I don't want that happening with me, but I also love you sm I can't ever leave you, i really don't know what all is going on in my head rn, it's gonna fucking explode rn

[29/12/25, 11:09:10 PM] Samuel Manas: i shouldn’t have asked you ‘what’s wrong’ so many times… lesson learnt.. i won’t from now on

i love you mishu bangaram 😘😘

[10/01/26, 3:54:50 AM] Himisha: baby i just woke up again 
i was feeling so uncomfortable suddenly, in my stomach, and it felt like full gas form ayyindi and j was getting those chinna sounds again and i felt like i HAD to poop, i got up and sat on the bed and my stomach was making very loud noises, it wasn't like the hungry growling noises, it was so loud and it was as if you move a long metal object from one place to another while it's screeching onto another metal object types
so i went to the washroom, and as soon as I sat down, everything came out

[10/01/26, 3:57:00 AM] Himisha: was it the chicken or is it cuz of the tablet or is it because I had to get everything out since morning and it came out this way or is it nazar, idk, cuz my grandpa is also in that situation and now mujhe yeh hua
